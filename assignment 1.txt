DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LENGTH AND LENGTH()
LENGTH VARIABLE =
     1)  The length variable is applicable to an array but not for string objects.
       FOR EXAMPLE-
       int[] array = new int[4];
       System.out.println("The size of the array" + array.length);
       OUTPUT :The size of the array is 4.
       2) The length variable in an array returns the length of an array i.e. a number of elements stored in an array.

LENGTH METHOD =
       1)The length() method is applicable for string objects but not for arrays.
        FOR EXAMPLE-
        String str = "AKSHAY";
        System.out.println("The size of the String is " + str.length());
        OUTPUT :The size of the String is 13
        2)The length() returns the length of a string object i.e. the number of characters stored in an object.

MULTIPLE INHERITANCE=
A SUBCLASS CONSIST OF MORE THEN ONE SUPERCLASS IT IS CALLED AS MULTIPLE INHERITANCE.
NOTE
1) THE TEAM WHO CREATED JAVA INSTED OF GIVING SOLUTION TO THE DIAMOND PROBLEM THEY SIMPLY RESTRICTED MULTIPLE INHERITANCE
2)MULTIPLE INHERITANCE IS NOT SUPPORTED IN JAVA WITH THE HELP OF CLASSES.

HYBRID INHERITANCE=
IT IS COMBINATION OF HEIRARCHICAL AND MULTIPLE INHERITANCE.
WE CAN NOT ACHIEVE HYBRID INHERITANCE.
